## Installation

```
bundle install
rails db:migrate && rails db:seed
rails s

```
Copy the resulting url listed as `Listening on [url]` (often it will be localhost:3000), paste the url into your browser & voila.
If there are problems, start by checking that the data has seeded by running `rails c`, then `User.all` 
      
      
## Usage

* A user can login or sign up
* If signing up, the user can update their default profile info
* On a user's profile page is their DJ info, created playlists and liked playlists
* Here, a user can create a new playlist
* A search bar on the navigation bar allows the user to search for songs, artists, albums, spotify playlists, and other users on the app
* Entering a search brings the user to a page with the results listed out and the options to add songs to the user's playlist or see other users' profile
